# CS2800-Quiz
This is project 4 for Web Dev CS2800. 

This project required me to come up with a topic of choice, write some content for it, and then write a quiz for the content the user read about. There are two parts to this project: 
1. writing the quiz in Javascript
2. Converting the Javascript to jQuery. 

If anyone viewing this repo has any ideas for features or improvements, feel free to make an issue!
