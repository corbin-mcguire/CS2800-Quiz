            There are many reasons to build a custom computer. Whether you need it
            for school, a large project, or just sitting back a playing some games,
            building a PC could be for you. At first many people are intimidated by
            building their own computer, but after practice and research, its a
            simple as building a Lego set. First step would be to evaluate what your
            use cases for your machine are. Are you a gamer? Do you need a lot of
            power for 3D modeling or rendering? Do you need something that can edit
            spreadsheets and run word processors? Deciding what you need a computer
            for will help when deciding what parts to pick out.

            Getting a list of parts needed for a system isn't hard. All computers
            need a CPU, GPU, motherboard, power supply, memory and a storage device.
            Where things start to vary is needing to run intense games or rendering
            a 4K video in a short time or just being able to run Microsoft Word.
            Running games and rendering videos requires a lot of power and
            resources, and this is where the prices can shoot up. Basic tasks like
            web browsing and word processing require minimal resources and smaller
            inexpensive solutions are possible. A case to put all your components in
            is also recommended.
        </p>

            After you've taken the time to research all the parts you need for you
            system, its time to build! First thing is first, move to a place where
            static electricity will be minimal as it can damage your components.
            Make sure you have a large surface to work on and have a screwdriver
            handy. Unbox all of your components so its easier to build without
            having to mess around with boxes. The first components we will be
            working with are the CPU, motherboard, power supply, and memory. The
            motherboard is where all the components secure to in order for the
            system to turn on and function.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before installing any other components, we will install the power supply
            first. Installing it before the rest of the components will make it
            easier because all the cables will be installed and the components will
            just need hooked up. Looking at your motherboard, you will see a covered
            socket. This is where the CPU will be placed. To the right, and
            depending on what motherboard you bought, the left, will be the slots to
            put the memory. Place your CPU into the socket and be careful not to
            bend any of the pins. Next, slot the memory into the slots adjacent to
            the CPU sockets. After the CPU and memory has been installed, its time
            to move onto the storage and GPU.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next we need to wire up the storage device, this can be a hard drive or
            solid state drive, both of which have variations between them. The
            storage devices need a cable running from the motherboard and a cable
            running from the power supply. This allows the HDD or SSD to have a data
            connection to the motherboard and have power. Next is GPU. If you are
            not building a powerful system then chances are that your CPU includes
            an integrated GPU and the installation is already complete.
            Alternatively, you bought a separate graphics card and now we need to
            install it. There will be PCIe slots under the CPU socket, this is where
            the GPU will be placed. After the GPU is slotted in, connect it to the
            power supply. That's it! Now all the components are installed and you
            just built your own computer! Are you ready for the quiz?
